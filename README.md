## Controlled Accuracy in Interval Estimation in Sequential Analysis with Poisson Data: Monitoring Adverse Events Following Newly Marketed Drugs and Vaccines

The scientific initiation project addresses the use of sequential statistical analysis in Poisson data to monitor adverse events from drugs and vaccines. The work focuses on developing methodologies to improve accuracy in relative risk estimates, emphasizing the importance of monitoring time. Through a literature review and statistical analyses, the report significantly contributes to public health safety, offering optimized methods for early detection of risks in newly marketed drugs and vaccines. The conclusion emphasizes the practical relevance of the developed methods and suggests directions for future research in the field
